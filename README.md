ofxPDSPPatches
=====================================

This is a set of high level classes that builds upon [ofxPDSP](https://github.com/npisanti/ofxPDSP).  [ofxWatchFile](https://github.com/nariakiiwatani/ofxWatchFile.git) is also required for some classes to work, but not on Android and iOS. All the classes have a `ofParameterGroup parameters` member that can be easily added to a gui for tweaking things faster in realtime. Some `ofx::patch::sequencer` loads text file in realtime and are updated when the text file changes.

Included `ofx::patch::sequencer`:
- `Euclidean` : euclidean rhythm generator
- `Tracker` : file based tracker with probability for each step 
- `MarkovChain` : file based markov chain sequence
- `Wolfram` : wolfram automata to rhymtm
   
Included `ofx::patch::synth` :
- `DataSynth` : datasynth class from the data-to-wave example
- `GrainDrone` : granular sampler with 4 comb resonators
- `KarplusStrong` : karplus strong string synthesizer
- `MultiSampler` : from the example-scoring3, good for slicing
- `NoiseDevice` : clicks and noise burst synthesizer
- `QuickSampler` : loads a single sample right even from the gui on the fly
- `SinePercussion` : zaps and beeps percussion
- `WaveSynth` : wavetable based synthesizer

Included `ofx::patch::effect` :
- `BasiVerb` : pdsp::BasiVerb wrapper with all the parameters on the gui
- `Chorus` : pdsp::DimensionChorus with all the parameters on the gui
- `Cruncher` : bitcrunching and decimation
- `Ducker` : pdsp::Ducker with all the parameters on the gui
- `Filter` : multimode filter 
- `RingMod` : ring modulator
- `StereoDelay` : L/R delay with different time 

Included `ofx::patch::tuning` :
- `PitchTable` : a vector of ofxPDSPValue for pitches 
- `PureTuning` : a vector of pitches generated by integer ratios calculations

Included `ofx::patch::dynamics` :
- `Brickwall` : brickwall limiter followed by an oversampled soft clipper
- `Compressor` : pdsp::Compressor with analog like envelope timing and peak/RMS mode
